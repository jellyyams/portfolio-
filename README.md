# A React + Typescript + Vite portfolio site

React is, we can all agree, overkill for a small portfolio site. There's nothing fancy going on with this project, it's just meant to be a brief refresher on react as well as a chance to learn the most current standards for implementing a react project.

I'm making this repo public in case there's anyone else interested in building a small react project for their portfolio site.

A longer term goal for this site is to add the Google Drive API so I can update and add pages to the site via files stored in Google drive.

## Running
