# A React + Typescript + Vite portfolio site

React is, we can all agree, overkill for a small portfolio site. There's nothing fancy going on with this project, it's just meant to be a brief refresher on react as well as a chance to learn more current standards for implementing a react project.

I'm making this repo public in case there's anyone else interested in building a small react project for their portfolio site.

## Live website

The live site is hosted on github pages. view the portfolio site [here](https://jellyyams.github.io/portfolio-/)

## Running

"npm run dev"

## Installing packages

to install a package run "npm i package-name --save"
