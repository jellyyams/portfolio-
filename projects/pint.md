During my undergraduate studies at Olin College of Engineering, I was a member and one of the project managers organizing events for our campus’ [Public Interest Technology (PInT) organization](https://pint.olin.edu). PInT is a student-run club that hosts a variety of speaker events, fellowship programs, discussion groups, and tech consulting projects for students to explore the social and ethical implications of technology development.

The club consisted of 20-30 members and 5-10 leadership staff that assisted with various budgeting, marketing, grant writing, and organizing responsibilities. As a relatively young organization, our main projects during my involvement included finalizing the logo, website, mission and vision statement, and setting up a physical space for students to gather. The leadership team also spent a significant amount of time on finding ways to mentor and support various consulting projects. PInT worked with nonprofits such as [EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/), [Out Maine](https://www.outmaine.org/), and [Crotched Mountain](https://cmf.org/) to give students hands-on experience with applying human centric principles and design practices to build technological solutions. Throughout the semester, we’d also invite speakers to host open discussions about their work in the public interest tech space.

Besides the logistical work of planning events and hosting consulting projects, I also helped design activities to scaffold discussions around the role that public interests play in influencing technology development. Discussion topics ranged from the ethics of AI to data privacy to techno solutionism to feminist technologies. We hoped to foster a space where students felt invited to critique the social, political, and cultural forces that shape technology and, in turn, are shaped by technology.

In the process of trying to establish PInT’s identity on campus, we were forced to confront our personal stances on the roles that engineers should play in influencing society. As part of the leadership team, we spent dozens of hours pouring ideas out on sticky notes and Miro boards, trying to make sense of the increasingly complex world of technology development and engineering education. My time at PInT laid the foundation for my current quest to confront and reimagine the paradigms that govern technology development.

Olin PInT was established in 2019 with a grant from the [PIT-UN network](https://pitcases.org/).
