As part of my final research project at the School for Field Studies, I worked in a team of five students to research the social psychology of the 2023 Cobre Panama protests. Applying a comprehensive survey methodology, we gathered data from 151 panamanians residing throughout the Bocas Del Toro archipelago to determine which social, cultural, and emotional factors correlated with protest engagement.

In October of 2023, president Laurentino Cortizo signed a controversial law that would allow a Canadian mining company, First Quantum Minerals, to continue to[operate the Cobre Panama open-pit copper mine for at least another 20 years](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/first-quantum-mine-1.7027019). In response, mass protests erupted across Panama, reaching an unprecedented scale of social and political unrest since the National Civic Crusade of 1987. Protestors instituted road blockades that led to mass shortages of essential goods, such as food and fuel, in remote parts of the country. Despite the fact that Bocas del Toro was chronically impacted by these shortages, hundreds of Bocas residents organized and participated in protests and boat blockades in support of the Cobre Panama protest.

Relying on the motivational framework proposed by [Van Stekelenburg & Klandermans 2013](https://doi.org/10.1177/0011392113479314), our research group formulated a 40 question survey that explored the roles that belief in efficacy, identity, emotions, grievances, and social embeddedness played in influencing protest engagement. Our goal was to determine why Bocas residents participated in the protests despite the large personal costs and the lack of geographic proximity to the site of the mine.

Over the course of two weeks, we conducted in person survey based interviews with over 150 residents asking them to answer demographic questions (age, place of residency, indigenous or non indigenous) and self-identify as one of six different levels of protest engagement, with options ranging from “I don’t support the protests” to “I support the protests but haven’t actively participated” to “I support the protests and have participated in road or boat blockades”. Respondents were then asked to rank their agreement or disagreement on a five point Likert scale to statements such as “I feel angry about the mining contract”, and “The political processes that led to the mining contract are unethical”. Respondents had the option to either answer in Spanish or English.

After running inferential statistical methods, such as ANOVA, t-tests, and Tukey HSD tests on our results, our research group found that a sense of collective national identity and consciousness played a statistically significant role in influencing protest engagement. We also found that concerns over the ethics of political processes statistically correlated with protest engagement while environmental concerns did not.

These findings suggest that not only do the protests represent a deeper, nationwide discontent with Panama’s political processes, but that environmental concerns were not the primary motivator for protest engagement. They also suggest, somewhat paradoxically, that Panamanians viewed the anti-government protests as an act of patriotism and that Panamanians sustain a sense of collective national identity separate from their political leaders and federal government.

The research project culminated in a 30 page paper and a brief video presentation and poster session open to the Bocas del Toro community. This project was supported by the School for Field Studies, and advised by Dr. Cinda Scott and Dr. Leon Mach.
