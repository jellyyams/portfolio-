For my Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship capstone project at Olin College of Engineering, I co-managed a team of 5-8 students to develop data tools and run an air purifier distribution program in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Roxbury is a recognized environmental justice community that has historically experienced some of the highest asthma rates and worst air quality in all of Boston. Our community partner, [Alternatives for Community and Environment (ACE)](https://ace-ej.org) has spent 25+ years advocating for clean air, accessible transit, and renewable energy in Roxbury. Our cohort was part of the Air Partners team for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters, however [Air Partners](https://airpartners.org) has been a part of Boston’s environmental justice and advocacy network since 2016.

Our team’s main task both semesters was to quantify the effectiveness of high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers on reducing indoor PM 2.5 and PM10 air pollution. Our team of students ran two HEPA purifier distribution pilot programs in Roxbury, Massachusetts— the first at a mixed income apartment building and the second at an assisted living community. For each pilot, our team developed community engagement strategies such as flyers, door to door chats, and information sessions to raise awareness of the purifier distribution program. In total, over 30 households participated in the program. At the conclusion of both pilot programs, we analyzed the purifier usage patterns and air quality data to determine the efficacy of relying on HEPA purifiers to reduce indoor air pollution. We also collected feedback about each household's experience with using the purifers.

Due to technical difficulties (sensors would go offline sporadically) and a wide range of usage habits (some households left the purifier on constantly while others didn’t use the purifier at all), we were unable to arrive at statistically conclusive evidence about the efficacy of HEPA purifiers. The pilot programs were, however, effective at revealing attitudes towards and usage patterns of HEPA purifiers, which ACE and Air Partners leveraged to inform future initiatives to improve air quality in Roxbury. We presented our findings at a public information session and celebration wrapping up the pilot program.

In addition to running purifier distribution programs, our team also continued work on a community owned outdoor air quality sensor network. The network consists of 19 [Quant AQ sensors](https://www.quant-aq.com) that feeds data into a web app built by previous Air Partners students. We co-designed with community members to arrive at intuitive and useful web tools that allow the public to access reliable information about their air quality. These tools were also designed to assist ACE and their partners with clean transit policy advocacy work. 

The HEPA pilot project was funded by a grant from the [Barr Foundation](https://www.barrfoundation.org/) to develop and pilot a replicable model for community-led air justice in Roxbury.
