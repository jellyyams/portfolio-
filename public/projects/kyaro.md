During the Summer of 2021 I joined a small team of volunteers to work with [Kyaro Assistive Tech](https://www.kyaroassistive.org/en/), a young nonprofit based in Arusha, Tanzania. My primary responsibilities included redesigning their logo, developing a coherent brand identity, and setting up a website that would reach both domestic and international audiences. I was also the designated photographer for outreach events and took photos in both a studio and field environment.

Since Kyaro’s products serve patients with a variety of physical disabilities, the leadership team wanted a logo that wasn’t centered around a wheelchair. I used Adobe Illustrator to sketch out a variety of logo ideas and through several rounds of feedback sessions, we gradually narrowed in on one design. More details of the logo design process can be found in this [blog post](https://www.kyaroassistive.org/en/blog/introducing-kyaros-new-logo) on their website. 

Once we finalized the logo, we spent several dozens of hours discussing the mission statement, vision statement, and visual design guidelines for Kyaro. Working in a design consultancy role, my job was to guide and structure these discussions and bring in an informed perspective on how best to formalize Kyaro’s brand identity. After helping establish Kyaro’s new brand, I set up a Squarespace website with bilingual (Swahili and English) capabilities to reach potential partners, donors, and patients. 



Throughout the Summer, I was also responsible for photographing product deliveries, patient evaluations and follow ups, and Kyaro’s manufacturing process at their Arusha workshop. These excursions took me all around Tanzania, giving me the chance to encounter people and communities from vastly different cultural backgrounds than my own. I also took and edited photos of Kyaro’s assistive devices in a studio setting to build an online catalog of products that patients and doctors throughout East Africa could reference. Photos were shot with a Nikon system and edited in Adobe Lightroom. Some of the photos I took were later published in an inflight magazine for Precision Air (Paa Tanzania) in an article about work organizations in Tanzania.

My work that Summer was funded by Kyaro Assistive Tech and Olin’s Public Interest Technology Fellowship.
