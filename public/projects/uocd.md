The Collaborative Design course at Olin College takes students through a semester-long user research design process, starting with just a user group and ending with a service/product. I worked in a team of five students to design a solution for urban planners. Due to Covid-19, this project was conducted virtually via video calls and miro boards.

We began with 11 unstructured interviews with urban planners at various stages of their career. Some were students studying at Master's programs, while others had worked in the field for years or even decades. The interviews lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half, during which we would write down everything the user did, thought, said, and felt. The goal of these interviews was to immerse ourselves in the world of urban planning and organically understand the primary beliefs, values, and day to day challenges of urban planning.

After completing all 11 interviews, we were then tasked with creating personas that captured the patterns of core beliefs and frustrations. We used visual and conceptual tools such as venn diagrams and spectrums to find the common factors that tied each persona together.

At the end of these initial 11 interviews, we were also left with some lingering questions and insights to explore in the next stage.

Next we entered an ideation phase, generating hundreds of potential ideas and gradually narrowing down on four top ideas to bring into codesigns.

We designed an interactive co-design miro board that would allow us to not only solicit feedback, but also give the users an opportunity to directly play with, modify, and iterate on the digital representations of each idea.

After completing co-designs with seven users, we synthesized our findings into 2 big insights: 

[1] Urban planning projects are very cost driven while urban planners themselves are often social impact driven. How can we help urban planners work on projects they care about within the confines of a capistalist system? 
[2] Urban planners and cities don't frequently communicate with other planners/cities, making it difficult to learn about solutions that already exist in other parts of the world. How do we increase collaboration and communication between planners of different cities? 

We used these insights to go through another round of ideation and arrived at our top 10 ideas.

At the end of the course, we selected one of these top ideas to present as the final “product” we designed for urban planners. Our group decided to propose an international work exchange program that would allow urban planners to work with and learn from urban planners from different parts of the world. This program would also give planners the opportunity to work on environmental or socially oriented projects that align with their values.
